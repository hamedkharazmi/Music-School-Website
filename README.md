# Music-School-Website
a Website for managing Music Schools. (implemented For the "Database Lab" university course)

For my Database Lab final project, with another undergraduate student, we created a website for managing music schools. We developed both front and back ends and designed different UI/UX for students and managers. They could access their personalized panel through automatic authentication.
